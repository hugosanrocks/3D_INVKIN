# multiibemdwn3dgeneral


This sub-repository contains the main code to perform wave propagation simulations inside layered media using the IBEM-DWN method following [Perton et al. (2016)](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/205/3/1832/657753?login=false). Some auxiliary post-processing and I/O tools are provided in order to write the output files (stress tensor) in a format which is compatible with the forward and inverse modeling code 3D_INVKIN.
