!Last line of inputs:
nsamp dt nsampint nsamptracint nsampsynint

!Attention:
The time sampling for the time interpolation
of the slip-rate is estimated as:

   dtint = ((nsamp-1)*dt)/(nsampint-1)

Time sampling for synthetic seismograms, observations and traction file
must be equal to dtint to correctly estimate the convolutions of the 
forward modeling.

Remember that:  (not to run on allocation errors)

   nsampint + nsamptracint - 1 > nsampsynint
