To reproduce the example, you need to install Madagascar for visuallization. 
Then, do the following things sequentially in each subdirectory:
1. make
  It will generate executable: test.x
2. ./text.x
   run this executable to obtain the binary output
3. scons view
   use Madagascar to visualize the output
4. scons -c
   remove intermediate files generated by Madagascar 
5. make clean
   remove all things generated by codes
