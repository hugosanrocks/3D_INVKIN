Acknowledgements:
The SEISCOPE Interpolation TOOLBOX codes have been developed in the
framework of the SEISCOPE and SEISCOPE II consortia and we thank
the sponsors of these projects. 

-------------------------------------------------------
Conditions of use:
The SEISCOPE OPTIMIZATION TOOLBOX code is provided open-source (see Legal Statement). 
Please refer to the two following articles in any study or publications for which
this code has been used

[1] Yang, P., Brossier, R., and Virieux, J. (2016). Wavefield reconstruction
   from significantly decimated boundaries. Geophysics, submitted.

-------------------------------------------------------
Content
1. Boundary reconstruction by DFT interpolation
2. Boundary reconstruction by Kaiser-windowed sinc interpolation
3. Boundary reconstruction by Lagrange polynomial interpolation

Currently, only temporal decimation and interpolation has been implemented.
The data compression for storing in memory can be further improved by spatial 
decimation, which will be a future work!

------------------------------------------------------
Compilation and usage:

1. cd src; 
2. make;
3. For specific use of boundary interpolation, go to /demo;
   find a good example as the template; specify the variables and their size!
