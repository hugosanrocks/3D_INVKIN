To reproduce the example, you need to install Madagascar for visuallization. 
Then, do the following things sequentially in each subdirectory:
1. make test [GNU=1 or XL=1]
  It will:
- generate executable: test.x
- run this executable to obtain the binary output
2. scons view
   use Madagascar to visualize the output
3. scons -c
   remove intermediate files generated by Madagascar 
4. make distclean
   remove all things generated by examples (clean and testclean)
