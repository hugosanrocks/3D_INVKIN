The directory OPTIMIZATION gathers all the 
optimization routines developed within the 
SEISCOPE CONSORTIUM. The architecture of the
directory is as follows: 
- lib : contains the global library resulting from 
the compilation of all the optimization routines
- COMMON : contains the source code and the data
structures which are shared by all the optimization 
routines.

The directory contains 6 subdirectories associated
with the following optimization routines: 
PSTD (Preconditioned Steepest Descent)
PNLCG (Preconditioned Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient)
LBFGS (l-BFGS algorithm)
PLBFGS (preconditioned version of the l-BFGS algorithm)
TRN (truncated Newton method)
PTRN (preconditioned truncated Newton method)

To build the global library, type
make lib
To clean the global library, type 
make clean

The command make lib will create the static library
libSEISCOPE_OPTIM.a in the directory lib which shall be linked
using the compilation option
-L $(PATH) -lSEISCOPE_OPTIM 
where $(PATH) should give the path to the directory lib which 
contains libSEISCOPE_OPTIM.a

All the optimization routines are built on the 
same reverse communication architecture. To see
how they can be used, report to the test directories 
of the particular optimization routines.
