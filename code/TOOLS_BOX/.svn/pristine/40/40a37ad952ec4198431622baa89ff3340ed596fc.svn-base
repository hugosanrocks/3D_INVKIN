-------------------------------------------------------
Conditions of use:
The SEISCOPE OPTIMIZATION TOOLBOX code is provided open-source (see Legal Statement). 
Please refer to the two following articles in any study or publications for which
this code has been used

   from significantly decimated boundaries. Geophysics, Vol. 81 No. 5 pp. T197â€“T209

   saving: A staggered grid GPU implementation, Computers & Geosciences 68 (2014)

-------------------------------------------------------
Content
1. Boundary reconstruction by DFT interpolation
2. Boundary reconstruction by Kaiser-windowed sinc interpolation
3. Boundary reconstruction by Lagrange polynomial interpolation

Currently, only temporal decimation and interpolation has been implemented.
The data compression for storing in memory can be further improved by spatial 
decimation, which will be a future work!

------------------------------------------------------
Compilation/tests and usage: ([] means optional)

1. cd INTERPOLATION; 
2. make [GNU=1 or XL=1] [DBG=1];
3. For specific use of boundary interpolation, go to /demo;
   find a good example as the template; specify the variables and their size!
4. OPTIONAL - global testing : 
   cd ./INTERPOLATION ; make test [GNU=1 or XL=1] [DBG=1]
5. Remove all files generated by the compilation & test phase
   cd ./INTERPOLATION & make clean
