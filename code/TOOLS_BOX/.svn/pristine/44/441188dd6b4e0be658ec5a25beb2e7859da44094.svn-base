* SEISCOPE TOOLS_BOX  *
***********************
-------------------------
Responsible: L. Metivier
-------------------------

This directory intends to gather the methodological tools that can 
be shared between the different SEISCOPE CODES. 

For now, the TOOL_BOX contains 2 librairies: 
# the optimization TOOL_BOX, which shall 
contain the following methods :
- Preconditioned Steepest Descent (PSTD)
- Preconditioned Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient (PNLCG)
- l-BFGS (LBFGS)
- Preconditioned l-BFGS (PLBFGS)
- Truncated Newton (TRN)
- Preconditioned Truncated Newton (PTRN)
These methods are implemented following a reverse communication 
strategy so as to simplify their use. More details can be found
in the OPTIMIZATION directory. 

# the SU_IO library to read/write Seismic Unix (SEGY) data format



-------------------------------
Installation and documentation

Adapt the Makefile.inc to your environment  and just type 'make'

The Optimization tool_box contains its own documentation located OPTIMIZATION/doc
