Acknowledgements:
The SEISCOPE OPTIMIZATION TOOLBOX codes have been developed in the
framework of the SEISCOPE and SEISCOPE II consortia and we thank
the sponsors of these projects. We also thank the French National 
Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) for his support. Access to 
the high  performance computing facilities of the meso-center CIMENT 
(Univ. Grenoble Alpes, Fr, https://ciment.ujf-grenoble.fr/) provided 
the required computer resources to develop this package.

Comments/Compilation:
1. The directory ./doc contains the SEISCOPE_OPTIMIZATION
   MANUAL. You will find in the MANUAL all the required
   information to compile and use the SEISCOPE_OPTIMIZATION
   TOOLBOX.

2. The architecture of the SEISCOPE OPTIMIZATION TOOLBOX
   is as follows: 
   - lib : contains the global library resulting from 
   the compilation of all the optimization routines
   - COMMON : contains the source code and the data 
   structures which are shared by all the optimization 
   routines.
   - The directory contains 6 subdirectories associated
     with the following optimization routines: 
     PSTD (Preconditioned Steepest Descent)
     PNLCG (Preconditioned Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient)
     LBFGS (l-BFGS algorithm)
     PLBFGS (preconditioned version of the l-BFGS algorithm)
     TRN (truncated Newton method)
     PTRN (preconditioned truncated Newton method)

3. To compile the code, modify the file Makefile.inc
   to set the name of the FORTRAN compiler you may want 
   to use. 
   The command make lib will create the static library
   libSEISCOPE_OPTIM.a in the directory lib.
   This lib shall be linked using the compilation option
   -L $(PATH) -lSEISCOPE_OPTIM 
   where $(PATH) should give the path to the directory lib which 
   contains libSEISCOPE_OPTIM.a

4. To validate the compilation, you can run:
	 make test (or make test GNU=1)
