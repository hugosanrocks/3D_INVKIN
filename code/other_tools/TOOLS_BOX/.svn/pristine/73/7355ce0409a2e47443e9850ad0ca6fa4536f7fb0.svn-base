-> get_nr_su.f90 : generic and used version (in Makefile) to search size of file through a dichotomy with a bloc size equal to the trace 
 
-> get_nr.f90 : generic and not-used version (not in Makefile, but can be put) to search size of file through a dichotomy with a bloc size equal to 1 byte, less efficient than  get_nr_su.f90 

-> get_nr_stat.f90 : not-generic (not in the Fortran norm, but supported by several compilers) version using the fstat command
