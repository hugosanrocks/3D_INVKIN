To reproduce this example, you need to go into the subdirectory and:
1. make [GNU=1 or XL=1] &&  ./test._carfs.x
OR make [GNU=1 or XL=1] && make test [GNU=1 or XL=1]
2. scons view (if you installed Madagascar, only for visualization)
   ximage < forw.bin n1=301 (if you installed Seismic Unix)

To remove all the intermediate files, you need:
1. scons -c
2. make testclean 

We assume the Seiscope optimization toolbox and Madagascar have been installed.
1). We use optimization toolbox to obtain Yl with least-squares minimization 
using the exact expression of Q(w).
2). Madagascar is used for the convenience of data I/O and visualization.

The matlab script demo_lsQ.m provides a convenient way to output the Q based on
the Yl  which is nearly a constant within the frequency band of interest.
