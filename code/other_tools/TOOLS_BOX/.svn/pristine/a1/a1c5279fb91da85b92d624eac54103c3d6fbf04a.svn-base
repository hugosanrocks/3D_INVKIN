Compile:
--------
Cf. DOMAIN_DECOMP/00README

Edit configuration file to modify options:
------------------------------------------
test_dd_sg_ac_iso_o4.config

Run:
----
sh run_dd_sg_ac_iso_o4.sh
launches test_dd_sg_ac_iso on 8 processors by default

Display seismogram:
-------------------
It is stored in 'P' file in binary format of 81 receivers on 1000 time steps.

ximage < P n1=1000

or launch octave/matlab and run the plot_seismogram.m script

Display 3D results:
-------------------
They are stored in binary vtk format and can be displayed with paraview.

paraview &

file/open output_bin_src1_it..vtk (open all the stored time steps)

In the properties panel:
- click on 'apply'
- select 'surface' instead of 'outline' as 'representation'
- select 'Pglob' instead of 'solid color' as 'coloring'

Edit 'color map', 'rescale to custom range': set min=-1 and max=1

Create slice filter
Change plan origin to the source origin, i.e. 4000 4000 500
click on 'apply'

choose +X as visualisation plan
launch 'play' to see the propagation simulation
 
Notice:
-------
Make sure that the configuration file is compliant with the running script:
the number of processors requested in the running script shall be equal to the product of the division of the global domain in all dimensions in the configuration file.
