This directory contains the routines associated with 
the steepest descent algorithm. 

- To build the library libPSTD.a, type 
make lib within the current directory. 

- To clean the library, type 
make clean within the current directory. 

The steepest descent algorithm which is proposed 
is implemented following a reverse communication 
strategy. To see how it can be used, please go to 
the test directory. 

- To compile the test directory, type
make test within the current directory.

- To clean the test, type 
make testclean within the current directory.

- To remove all generated files by compilation &
test phase type:
make distclean

The source code for the test should be consulted to 
see how the reverse communication strategy works. 
The user is only asked to provide :
- the maximum number of iteration in optim%niter_max
- the convergence criterion in optim%conv
- the dimension of the problem n
- the cost and gradient associated with the initial guess x 
In addition, the variable FLAG have to be initialized to 'INIT'.

The test implements the minimization of the Rosenbrock function. 
The steepest descent converges slowly to the minimum of this function
which (1.,1.). More details on the Rosenbrock function can be found here:
