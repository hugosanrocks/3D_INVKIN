3D Kinematic Inversion of seismic sources 28/12/2017

A successful compilation can be done by running:
chmod + compile.sh
./compile.sh

To compile all the objects refered to the 3D_INVKIN:

make [option]           Inside this directory ../obj/

options:


PREPROC_GEODG		Compiles only the codes used
			to prepare the pseudo Green's
			function bank (traction on the
			fault).

FORWARD			Compiles only the codes used
			to run a forward modeling
			(synthetic seismograms).

IN3DVKIN                Compiles only the main code 
                        to invert the seismic source.

HESSIAN                 Compiles the codes related to
                        the estimation of the Hessian
                        matrix.

SENSITIVITY             Compiles the codes related to
                        a sensitivity analysis carry out
                        through several gradient estimations

all			Complies all options
			mentioned aboce.

clean			Removes all the objects
			from this directory.

The binary files are located inside ../bin/

Check ../run/ to see an example of a finite source
inversion. The files preprocess.sh forward.sh
and inversion.sh are scripts with the necessary 
commands to prepare the pseudo Green's functions,
estimate synthetic seismograms and run a kinamtic
source inversion process, respectively.
